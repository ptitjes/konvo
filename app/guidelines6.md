Here are the guidelines for implementing the simple clock application as specified:

**Project Structure**

1. The project should be structured in the following folders:
   - `src`: This will contain all source code.
     - `components/`: Directory for React components (analogic and digital clocks).
     - `containers/`: Directory for container components that combine multiple presentational components (alarms management, notifications).
     - `models/`: Directory for data models (alarms).
     - `services/`: Directory for database services (sqlite connection).
   - `main.tsx`: The main entry point.
   - `index.html`: The HTML template for the Electron application.

**General Code Organization Principles**

1. Each file should have a clear and concise purpose, with minimal coupling between them.
2. Use modules to separate concerns and make code reusable.
3. Utilize ES6+ syntax features (e.g., destructuring, object literals) to keep code clean and efficient.

**File-Naming and Coding Conventions**

1. **TypeScript**
   - Files should be named in PascalCase (e.g., `AlarmModel.ts`).
   - Function names should also follow PascalCase.
   - Use type annotations for all variables and function parameters.
2. **React Components**
   - Names of React components should be in PascalCase.
   - Props and state management should adhere to standard best practices (e.g., using destructuring, keeping data separate from presentation).

**Testing**

1. **Vitest Setup**
   - Set up tests for each module with at least unit tests for key functionalities.
   - Use Vitest assertions to verify expected behavior.

2. **Test Structure**
   - Each test file should be named similarly to the component or functionality it tests (e.g., `AlarmModel.test.ts`).
   - Test files should include a clear setup and teardown function if necessary.

**Build Tools**

1. **Type Checking**
   - Use TypeScript's strict type checking.
2. **Linting**
   - Configure ESLint with rules that adhere to the guidelines above.
3. **Compilation**
   - Utilize Webpack for bundling code, including React components, and other dependencies.

**Additional Guidelines**

1. **Alarm Persistence**: The alarms should be stored in a local SQLite database, with functionality to add, modify, and delete alarms.
2. **Notification Handling**: Use Electron's built-in notification API to emit notifications when an alarm chimes.
3. **Clock Implementation**: Implement both analogic and digital clock components that update in real-time.

Following these guidelines will ensure the application is well-organized, maintainable, and adheres to best practices for TypeScript and React development.
