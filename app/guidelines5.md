Here are some guidelines that can be used to assess the quality of your code:

1. **Project Structure:**
   - The project should follow a modular structure, with each module having its own directory.
   - Each module should have its own `src` directory containing the TypeScript source files and an `index.ts` file as entry point.

2. **General Code Organization Principles:**
   - All React components should be contained within their respective modules (`src/components`) and named following the component's purpose (e.g., `ClockComponent.tsx`, `AlarmList.tsx`, etc.).
   - Electron-specific code should reside in a separate module (`src/electron`).

3. **File-Naming Conventions:**
   - TypeScript files should end with `.ts`.
   - React functional components should have the suffix `_Component` (e.g., `ClockComponent.tsx` for `clock.js` file).

4. **Testing:**
   - All test cases should be written using Vitest and placed in a separate module (`src/tests`).
   - Tests should cover both functional and unit testing.

5. **Build Tools:**
   - Use tools like `tsc` to enforce TypeScript rules, including strict type checking.
   - Ensure that linting is enabled for the project, either through VSCode settings or an external linter like ESLint.

6. **Sqlite Integration:**
   - The database should be properly encapsulated within a module (`src/db`) using `sqlite3`.
   - All data access operations (CRUD) must be abstracted behind a well-defined API.

7. **Notifications:**
   - Use Electron's notification system to emit notifications when an alarm chimes.
   - Ensure that the system handles multiple alarms and their respective times correctly.

Here is an outline of how these guidelines could look in practice:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── AlarmList.tsx
│   ├── ClockComponent.tsx
│   └── ...
├── electron/
│   ├── main.ts
│   └── renderer.tsx
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── integration/
│       └── ...
└── db/
    └── alarms.js
```

By following these guidelines, you can ensure your codebase is well-organized and maintainable.
