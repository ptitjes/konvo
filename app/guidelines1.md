Here are the guidelines for implementing the application as per the given technologies:

**Project Structure and Code Organization:**
1. The project should be structured into the following main directories:
   - `src` (for TypeScript code): This directory contains all source files.
     - `components`: React components for rendering the clock and other UI elements.
     - `containers`: Containers that manage state and interactions with components.
     - `services`: Services that handle database operations (alarms persistence).
     - `utils`: Utility functions for tasks like date/time conversions, etc.
   - `main.ts` (Electron application entry point): Responsible for initializing the Electron app.
   - `index.html` (Electron HTML file): The main entry point of the web page displayed by Electron.

**General Coding Conventions:**
1. Use strict type checking in TypeScript files.
2. Follow standard JavaScript coding conventions like consistent indentation, spacing around operators, etc.
3. For React and Electron components, ensure they are pure and stateless when possible to maintain predictability.
4. Utilize ES6+ features (e.g., arrow functions, const where applicable) for cleaner code.

**Coding Conventions:**
- **TypeScript:**
  - Use meaningful names for variables and functions following camelCase convention.
  - Implement interfaces clearly with properties documented as necessary.
  - Ensure all code is type-safe; use TypeScript's static type checking to prevent runtime errors.
  
- **React:**
  - Components should be written in PascalCase (e.g., `DigitalClockComponent`).
  - Use stateless functional components where possible for better performance.
  - For class-based components, always define a constructor function and utilize the lifecycle methods correctly.

- **Electron:**
  - Keep Electron-specific code separate from React and TypeScript code to maintain modularity.
  - Ensure that all necessary setup (e.g., context menus, tray icons) is handled in `main.ts`.

**Database Operations with SQLite:**
1. Use a service to encapsulate database operations for alarms persistence.
2. Follow best practices for handling SQL queries, including prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.

By adhering to these guidelines, you'll ensure that your application is well-structured and maintainable while effectively utilizing the specified technologies.
